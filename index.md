Bahlai's Law says,

"Other people's data is always inconsistent and in the wrong format."

This short example will show how to take such data ---
in this case, a bibliography embedded in a spreadsheet ---
and turn it into something usable.

Along the way,
we will use all of the tools introduced so far
to extract, reformat, and analyze information
that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to work with.

We will end up taking spreadsheet data from two *different* spreadsheets and combining it to produce an answer to a (very small) research question.
