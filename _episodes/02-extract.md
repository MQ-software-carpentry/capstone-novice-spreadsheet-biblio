The first step is to turn the rows of the spreadsheet into (key, author) pairs.
Let's start by making sure that Python can read the spreadsheet properly:

~~~ 
# count-lines.py
# Count how many lines there are in the spreadsheet
import sys

filename = sys.argv[1]
count = 0

with open(filename, 'r') as reader:
    for line in reader:
        count += 1

print count
~~~
{: .language-python}

This should look familiar by now:
the filename is given as the first command-line argument (`sys.argv[1]`),
so we open that file and use a `for` loop to read it line by line.
Each time the loop executes,
it adds 1 to a variable called `count`;
when the loop finishes,
we close the file and print the count.

We can run this program like this:

~~~ 
$ python code/count-lines.py data/bibliography.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Sure enough, its output is:

~~~ 
2937
~~~
{: .output}

so we know that Python is reading all of the rows.

The next step is to break each line into fields
so that we can get each entry's key and authors.
The fields are separated by commas,
so we could try using `str.split`.
This won't work,
though,
because authors' names also contain commas (since they are formatted as "last, first").

What we can do instead is ask our favorite search engine for help.
Sure enough,
a search for "python csv" turns up
[a library called `csv`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html),
which is part of the standard Python distribution.
Its documentation includes a few examples,
and after a couple of experiments,
we come up with this:

~~~ 
# read-fields.py
# Make sure we can read the fields from a CSV file.

import sys
import csv

with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as raw:
    reader = csv.reader(raw);
    for line in reader:
        print line

~~~
{: .language-python}

This program starts by opening the bibliography file
(again, we'll pass its name as the first command-line argument).
It then calls `csv.reader` to create a wrapper around the file.
When the basic file object created by `open` reads a line at a time,
the wrapper created by `csv.reader` breaks that line into fields at the right places.
It knows how to handle commas embedded in fields,
special characters,
and a bunch of other things that we don't want to have to worry about.

To check that it's working correctly,
we just print out each line after it has been processed by the CSV reader.
Its first few lines of output are:

~~~ 
$ python code/read-fields.py data/bibliography.csv | head -5
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
{: .language-python .output}

(Notice that we run the program's output through `head` to only display the first few lines
rather than scrolling back through its output.)
This is exactly what we need:
the key is in the first element of each list,
and the authors are all together in the fourth.
Let's modify the program to print out just those two fields:

~~~ 
# display-fields.py
# Print the key and all the authors

import sys
import csv

with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as raw:
    reader = csv.reader(raw);
    for line in reader:
        print line[0], line[3]

~~~
{: .language-python}

Its output is:

~~~ 
8SW85SQM McClelland, James L
85QV9X5F McClelland, J. L.; McNaughton, B. L.; O'Reilly, R. C.

F5DGU3Q4 McCloskey, M.; Cohen, N. J.
PNGQMCP5 Buciluǎ, Cristian; Caruana, Rich; Niculescu-Mizil, Alexandru
~~~
{: .output}

The last step is to turn lines with multiple authors into multiple lines,
each with a single author.
This is the right time to use `str.split`:
the authors' names are separated by semi-colons,
so we can break each list of authors on those
and use another loop to print the results one by one:

~~~ 
$ python code/display-authors-1.py data/bibliography.csv | head -10
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~ 
8SW85SQM McClelland, James L
85QV9X5F McClelland, J. L.

~~~
{: .output}

That's close to what we want, but not quite right:
since authors' names are actually separated by a semi-colon and a space,
and we're only splitting on semi-colons,
the second and subsequent name on each line comes out with an unwanted space at the front.
What happens if we try to split on a semi-colon plus a space?

~~~ 
# display-authors-2.py
# Print (key, author) pairs.

import sys
import csv

with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as raw:
    reader = csv.reader(raw);
    for line in reader:
        key, authors = line[0], line[3]
        for auth in authors.split('; '): # semi-colon plus space instead of semi-colon
            print key, auth

~~~

And that's that:
the first step of our data extraction is done.
Since we've achieved something useful,
we save it for posterity:
