# Normalization

Normalization is the process of splitting data up into multiple tables. If we were going to continue this process and make this a research database, we would take the entire set of incoming data and break it up into multiple tables. 

To learn more about normalization, [this tutorial](http://holowczak.com/database-normalization/) is quite comprehensive. There are a few rules to remember:

* No multivalued attributes!
* Every row must have a "key" which uniquely identifies that row
* Every attribute must relate only to the key.

If we have time after adding data, we will explore how to normlize this bibliography. For now, let us focus on the quick and dirty solution.

# Transforming Data


We now have (key, author) pairs.
The next step is to put them in a relational database
so that we can start asking and answering questions.
Our starting point is the final script from the previous topic:

~~~ 
# display-authors-2.py
# Print (key, author) pairs.

import sys
import csv

with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as raw:
    reader = csv.reader(raw);
    for line in reader:
        key, authors = line[0], line[3]
        for auth in authors.split('; '): # semi-colon plus space instead of semi-colon
            print(key, auth)

~~~
{: .source .language-python}

whose output looks like this:

~~~ 
8SW85SQM McClelland, James L
85QV9X5F McClelland, J. L.
85QV9X5F McNaughton, B. L.
85QV9X5F O'Reilly, R. C.
Z4X6DT6N Ratcliff, R.
F5DGU3Q4 McCloskey, M.
F5DGU3Q4 Cohen, N. J.
PNGQMCP5 Buciluǎ, Cristian
PNGQMCP5 Caruana, Rich
PNGQMCP5 Niculescu-Mizil, Alexandru
~~~
{: .output}

What we *want* is data we can load with our prior commands. In order to do that, we need to write this back out as a different csv.

so let's modify the program to output this instead:

~~~ 
# convert-1.py
# Output a csv we can load into the database.

import sys
import csv

output_rows=[]

with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as raw:
    reader = csv.reader(raw);
    for line in reader:
        key, authors = line[0], line[3]
        for auth in authors.split('; '):
            output_rows.append([key, auth])

# We need a second argument for our output file
with open(sys.argv[2], 'w') as csvout:
    writer = csv.writer(csvout) #We are making a csv file from the second argument
    writer.writerow(["Key", "Author"]) #We need to make a header row
    writer.writerows(output_rows) #We need to dump the data we put into output_rows

print(len(output_rows)) #We need to know how many rows output_rows has so we can make sure they all make it into the database.

~~~
{: .source .language-python}


Lets run the program:

~~~
$ python convert-1.py bibliography_data/bibliography.csv key_author.csv
$ head key_author.csv
~~~
{: .source .language-bash}
This generates a beautful new csv ready for importing:

~~~
Key,Author
8SW85SQM,"McClelland, James L"
85QV9X5F,"McClelland, J. L."
85QV9X5F,"McNaughton, B. L."
85QV9X5F,"O'Reilly, R. C."
Z4X6DT6N,"Ratcliff, R."
F5DGU3Q4,"McCloskey, M."
F5DGU3Q4,"Cohen, N. J."
PNGQMCP5,"Buciluǎ, Cristian"
PNGQMCP5,"Caruana, Rich"
~~~
{: .output}

And we know that there are 6587 key-author pairs here.

Now, we need to make a script like we did at the start of the lesson to load this data.

Call the file `load_bibliography.sql`
~~~
.mode csv
.import key_author.csv key_author

.header on
.mode column

SELECT *
  FROM key_author
 LIMIT 10;

SELECT count(*)
  FROM key_author;
~~~
{: .source .language-sql}

And we run it in an in-memory database:

~~~
$ sqlite3
sqlite> .read load_bibliography.csv
~~~
{: .source}

We see:

~~~

That looks good,
so let's try asking some questions:

~~~ 
SELECT author, count(*) 
  FROM key_author 
 GROUP BY author 
 ORDER BY count(*) desc 
 LIMIT 10;
~~~
{: :source .language-sql}

~~~ 
Author          count(*)  
--------------  ----------
Bengio, Yoshua  122       
Bengio, Y.      111       
Hinton, Geoffr  78        
LeCun, Yann     56        
Hinton, G. E.   45        
Salakhutdinov,  34        
LeCun, Y.       31        
Vincent, Pasca  29        
Jordan, M. I.   27        
Frasconi, P.    25 
~~~
{: .output}

The first thing we see is that our work has paid off:
we can now find out who the most prolific authors are with a single command.
The second thing we see is that we're not done yet:
"Bengio, Yoshua" and "Bengio, Y." are almost certainly the same person,
as are "LeCun, Yann" and "LeCun, Y.".
If we really want to know who has written the most papers,
we're going to have to reconcile different names for the same person.

Instead of normalizing names and otherwise cleaning the data as part of our python processing step, let's see what other questions we can answer.

Who has co-authored papers with whom?

~~~ 
SELECT a.author, b.author 
  FROM key_author a 
  JOIN key_author b USING(key) 
 WHERE a.author > b.author
 LIMIT 10;
~~~
{: .source .language-sql}

~~~ 
Author             Author

(We use `a.author > b.author` to ensure that
each distinct pair of authors only shows up once.)
What if we want to know how often different pairs of people have written together?

~~~ 
SELECT a.author, b.author, count(*)
  FROM key_author a 
  JOIN key_author b USING(key) 
 WHERE a.author > b.author
 GROUP BY a.author, b.author
 ORDER BY count(*) desc
limit 10;
~~~
{: .source .language-sql}

~~~ 
Author           Author          count(*)  
---------------  --------------  ----------
Vincent, Pascal  Bengio, Yoshua  27        
Roux, Nicolas L  Bengio, Yoshua  20        
Delalleau, Oliv  Bengio, Yoshua  19        
Bengio, Y.       Bengio, S.      18        
Larochelle, Hug  Bengio, Yoshua  15        
Roux, Nicolas L  Delalleau, Oli  15        
Vincent, P.      Bengio, Y.      15        
Chapados, N.     Bengio, Y.      14        
Gori, M.         Frasconi, P.    14        
Salakhutdinov,   Hinton, Geoffr  14  
~~~
{: .output}

Again,
we have a data normalization problem:
the pair "Vincent, Pascal" and "Bengio, Yoshua"
is almost certainly the same as the pair "Bengio, Y." and "Bengio, S.".
But that problem would be there
even if we were analyzing this data manually,
and putting it in a database has made asking new questions so easy
that we can do research we otherwise wouldn't have been able to tackle.
The final step is to commit our script to Git
and celebrate with a nice cup of tea.
