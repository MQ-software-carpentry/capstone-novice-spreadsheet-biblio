# Software
For this course you will need the UNIX shell, plus [SQLite3](http://www.sqlite.org/).

If you are running Linux, you may already have SQLite3 installed, otherwise you
should be able to get it from your package manager (on Debian/Ubuntu, you can
use the command `apt install sqlite3`).

# Files
Please download the files we'll be using: [mpTwitterAndBiblio.zip]({{page.root}}/data/mpTwitterAndBiblio.zip)


### Shell and Python
The second part of the lesson requires the Python programming language (Version 3.5 or greater) and access to a command-line interface (shell) on your computer.
Please refer to [the Software Carpentry setup instructions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/#setup) for
*the Bash shell* and *Python* if you need guidance.

> ## Prerequisites
> This part of the lesson requires some prior knowledge of Python and how to use a shell.
> If you need help getting started on those topics, we suggest going through the following
> lessons first (during a workshop or on your own):
>
> * [The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
> * [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
